A repository to work in as I learn [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
and [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/), starting with [this Udemy
course](https://www.udemy.com/apache-spark-with-scala-hands-on-with-big-data/).

In this directory, `ml-100k` is a symbolic link to
`../../spark_scala_data/ml-100k`, which is expected to contain the contents of
the `ml-100k.zip` archive downloaded from [the MovieLens Dataset
archive](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/).

Similarly, `nba-shot-logs` is a symbolic link to
`../../spark_scala_data/nba-shot-logs`, which is expected to contain the file
`shot_logs.csv` downloaded from [the Kaggle NBA (2015) Shot Logs
dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs).
